But, for now:
1. if they have neither offer to install virtual box for them
2. if they have VB offer to use it
3. if they have fusion, offer to install/user VB or to see directions to use fusion.

What actually scares me is that I start to think about many things go wrong. Say, Betty's grandson is really advanced and set up custom vbox config, and it has several appliences to manage watering Betty's garden, manageing smarthome etc. And then Betty comes across Islands and gets our installer. Our installer finds vbox, asks, if Betty would like to use it. She presses "yes" and our installer screws up Betty's setup


Pseudocode on start:
   Check configuration.
   if found:
      Launch the app
   else:
      Search virtualization platforms
      
      if Virtualbox found:
         Ask if ISlands VM is already exists
      
         if exists:
            specify name or id of the VM
            save config,
            remain running
      
         else:
            offer to build islands VM and use it
      else:
         offer to use virtualbox
         if agree:
            install virtualbox
            install islands 
            save config
            remain running 
            
         else if vmware found:   
           offer to see docs for vmware usage
